# ComputationalGraph_for_Backpropagation

#Introduction
Computational graph for backpropagation is a tool used in deep learning to efficiently compute gradients 
during the training process. It represents the computations performed in a neural network as a graph, and 
enables efficient computation of gradients during the backward pass.
Two python files are designed to implement computational graph that is used to demonstrate backpropagation.
